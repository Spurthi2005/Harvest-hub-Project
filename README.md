# Harvest-hub-Project

Project Overview

In traditional markets, farmers often face challenges like:

High transportation costs for delivering produce over long distances

Dependence on middlemen for selling crops

Inconsistent and unfair pricing

HarvestHub solves these problems by providing a user-friendly online platform where farmers can:

--> List their crops directly from home

--> Showcase product quality using photos/videos

--> Provide accurate weight and pricing details

Buyers, in turn, can:

--> Browse verified crop listings

--> Choose flexible payment options (Online / COD)

--> Get doorstep delivery of fresh produce
